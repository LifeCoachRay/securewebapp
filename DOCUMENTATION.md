Hello! This is a website that helps you check if a website is secure or not.

You can enter a website address (like "google.com" or "facebook.com") into the box and click the "Check" button.

Then the website will tell you if the website is secure or not. The website will show green if the website is secure, and red if it is not.

Have fun checking website security!
